This is a project I need for skewl.

It is a mobile game using OpenGL as it's rendering engine.


It is currently just the engine but in the future I want to make a a layer of abstraction to make interacting with OpenGL and the Android API easier.

# how to install

just use android studio or smt, idk, I don't have time for this shit.
